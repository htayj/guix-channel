#!@SHELL@
# letter-hunt --guix-smoke: play and reload a real Letter Hunt game in PTYs.
#
# Upstream shows its welcome text in the message panel of the first game
# screen; it is not a modal prompt, and 'Q' is always "Quit and Save".  The
# first session therefore waits for that screen, takes a turn with 'h',
# inspects the character sheet with 'i', and saves with 'Q' plus a key.  The
# second session must load that save (the game unlinks letterhunt.sav only
# after load_stuff() opened it, before drawing the first screen), shows the
# character sheet again, and saves again; both saves must record the same
# avatar, score, words, and map.  The first session finds its state through
# XDG_STATE_HOME and the second through the HOME fallback, which name the same
# directory.  Every key is sent only after the screen it answers was drawn,
# and a session that exits early fails at once with its own output.
#
# All mutable files live below a disposable HOME/XDG tree that is removed on
# exit; the caller's own save is never touched.  The only line written to
# stdout is the success marker.  GOOCASTLE_RUNTIME_RAW_CAPTURE, when set,
# receives the second session's PTY stream up to the restored game's
# character sheet, before quitting leaves the alternate screen.
